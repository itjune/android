#Notepad app for Android (4.0 and higher)

##Features:
* add new note (yes that nice plus button)
* delete selected note (select a note or delete from edit screen)
* delete all notes (from main menu)

Say NO to empty title! Enter a title or it will be the first 10 symbols of note body. 

And yes, empty note means delete/don't create a note. 

My first android app WOOOOO-HOOOO
